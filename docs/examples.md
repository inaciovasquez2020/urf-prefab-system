Examples

Example 1
echo "All evaluations enforce FO^k-local refinement and bounded transcript capacity; acceptance requires a verifiable certificate." | urf-llm-check

Example 2
echo "A system can preserve perfect local homogeneity at all radii while having unbounded cycle overlap without any local witness." | urf-llm-check

Expected behavior
Example 1 should ACCEPT
Example 2 should REJECT
