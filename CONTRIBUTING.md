Contributing Guidelines
Scope discipline
Contributions must respect declared scope and non-goals
No new claims without updating STATUS.md and ASSUMPTIONS.md
Structure rules
New prefab-related documents go under docs/
Scripts go under tools/
CI changes must remain minimal and deterministic
Assumptions and invariants
Any new assumption must be added to ASSUMPTIONS.md
Prefab examples must reference assumption IDs explicitly
Review process
Small, atomic commits
Clear commit messages describing structural intent
No force-pushes to main
License
